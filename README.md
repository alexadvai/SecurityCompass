- **Ingest Scan Data**: Easily upload JSON-formatted security scan results to populate the asset graph.
- **Dynamic Filtering and Search**: Quickly find specific assets by name, ID, or type.
- **Detailed Asset Information**: Click on any asset to view a detailed panel with its metadata, tags, risk score, and known relationships.
- **AI-Powered Security Summary**: Get a concise, natural language summary of any asset's security posture, automatically generated by AI.
- **AI Risk Analysis**: Leverage AI to analyze assets and suggest potential new risky relationships that might have been missed in scans.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Switch between color schemes for optimal viewing comfort.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env .env.local
    ```
    Now, open `.env.local` and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    This file is already listed in `.gitignore` to keep your credentials secure.

3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
